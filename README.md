# BlogCat

> A handy add-on that makes blogging a first-class citizen on Firefox.

To learn how to use this add-on, go to our [getting started guide](https://blogcat.org/#/quickstart). Using the sidebar on the left, you can find out how BlogCat integrates with Firefox, how to read and subscribe to blogs, and how to be a part of the conversation by adding your blogging and microblogging accounts.

# Inspiration

This addon wouldn't exist if it was not for [FraidyCat](https://fraidyc.at) and [Rad Reader](https://cblgh.itch.io/rad-reader). They paved the way for BlogCat to find it's own path. If you'd rather have an app (or use a different browser), you might want to check them out.

# Ethos of BlogCat

The Web should be made by people and for people. We need tools that champion a human-centric web and the best way to do it is to foster an interconnected blogosphere. BlogCat aims to reduce friction between web browsing and blogging by making it easy to subscribe to blogs and also post. The Web should be a conversation.

Like the feed readers that inspired it, BlogCat strives for a calm experience. It doesn't fetch data in the background, it doesn't display badges or notifications. Use it on your time and terms. It only fetches blogs when you open the reader. Instead of a _river of news_ paradigm, it simply shows the recent updated blogs and few post titles. No single website can dominate the screen by overposting.

Instead of simply embedding a full application into the browser, BlogCat augments Firefox features. Clicking on a post will either open it on a new tab or using Firefox Reader (user configurable option). BlogCat is a user agent and a Firefox Add-on, it is not an app. It adds to Firefox instead of colonising it with itself.
