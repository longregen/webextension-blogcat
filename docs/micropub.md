## Are you a Wordpress user?

Chances are that if you have a blog, you're running Wordpress. You can use [this micropub plugin for Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub/) to enable posting to your blog from BlogCat. Be aware that BlogCat is yet to support [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth), so at the moment it is up to you to get an access token to your Micropub endpoint.
