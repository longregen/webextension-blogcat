BlogCat has a [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) viewer that allows you to listen to the podcast and navigate between seasons and episodes.

You can subscribe to your favourite podcast by adding the RSS feed for the podcast using the _Add feed_ menu item in the browser toolbar.

Podcasts will show up in the _Reader page_ like any other website you subscribe to, just their title, description and last few episodes. When you click on an episode, instead of going to the podcast page, BlogCat opens the episode in its built-in podcast viewer.
