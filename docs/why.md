Dear developer,

Did you look at the source code and screamed? Was it the commit history that made you crawl into a fetal position in the floor? The lack of tests, frameworks, bundlers, transpilers, or even a clear direction made you take three steps back and speed dial a priest? You're welcome.

> BlogCat is not a product. It exists in that liminal space between an art statement, an intervention against browser vendors, a wall full of strings and collages with arrows pointing to the word _blogginnnng!_

I created this because I wanted to use it. I made it in a way that allowed me to move extremely fast, like a cat doing zoomies at 3am (which incidently is when I did a ton of this add-on).

Some works are worthy of literature awards. They are done with great care, the hard labour of many hands, from the authors, to the agent, and all the editors and readers and publishing professionals. BlogCat is not that. BlogCat is that little scruffy notebook you carry with yourself. The one you keep scribbling nonsensical stuff that two months down the road you'll have no idea where you were going with it.

BlogCat is your blogging companion cat. It exists to serve its user and not its developers. It provides features to make the veil between blogging and web browsing thinner. **BlogCat is more s√©ance than science.** You have been warned.

I understand if the way this project is handled and all that it lacks in terms of modern web development is enough to make you move away from it. It would be better if you took your frustration and surprise and turned them into action. You can develop something similar in a way that pleases you. The more blogging add-ons and apps, the merrier.
