BlogCat allows you to post to both [microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) and [blogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogging) services. The current supported service types are [Bluesky](https://bsky.app), [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), and [Micropub](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/).

You can add as many posting accounts to BlogCat as you want and you can cross-post between them.

Both Mastodon and Bluesky are Microblogging platforms. Micropub is a W3C specification for posting to blogs. Many blogging services support Micropub or support plugins that enables them to exchange data with Micropub apps such as BlogCat.

To access your posting accounts, use the toolbar button and click _Manage Posting Accounts_.
