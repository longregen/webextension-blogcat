# Release 2025.3.2

Mainly bug fixes. Believe me, once you dive back into RSS and Atom feeds, you going to find some really strange feeds out there.

- **fix:** some feeds got no titles for a given item. In these cases show `contentSnippet`. If we don't have a title or a content snippet, just say "unknown".
- **fix:** stop trying to fix urls in `item.link`, not worth to preemptively fiddle with what is not broken.
