# Release 2025.4.1

## Fixes

- [issue 1](https://github.com/soapdog/webextension-blogcat/issues/1): problem importing from miniflux opml.

## Improvements

- Adding Feeds: will attempt to validate a feed before adding it. Valid feeds might still not load because our third-party feed parsing library is pickier than the W3C Validator.
