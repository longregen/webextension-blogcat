To start using BlogCat, you first need to subscribe to some websites. Just navigate to the websites you want to subscribe to and see if BlogCat can detect a feed from them. If it can, it will display an address bar button.

Clicking it allows you to open a popup and subscribe to the website.

The _add feed page_ lets you configure how often you want that website to be fetch and also allows you to rename it for your own convenience.

> If you're already using a [feed reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator) (also known as a _news aggregator_), you can export an OPML file from it and import into BlogCat as described in [importing OPML](/opml).

Once you subscribe to some feeds, you can use the browser toolbar button to _Open reader_.

The reader let's you check the latest posts for all the websites you're following.
